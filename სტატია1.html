	<section> <h3>
		
	&nbsp&nbsp The fennec fox is the smallest of all the world's foxes, but its large ears, measuring 6 inches, appear to be on loan from a bigger relative. <br> Fennec foxes dwell in the sandy Sahara and elsewhere in North Africa. Their nocturnal habits help them deal with the searing heat of the desert environment, <br> and some physical adaptations help as well.<br> &nbsp&nbsp
	 Their distinctive, batlike ears radiate body heat and help keep the foxes cool. They also have long, thick hair that insulates them during cold nights and protects <br> them from hot sun during the day. Even the fox's feet are hairy, which helps them perform like snowshoes and protects them from extremely hot sand. The fox's <br> feet are also effective shovels for frequent digging-fennec foxes live in underground dens.

	<section><h3>&nbsp&nbsp	These foxes dwell in small communities, each inhabited by perhaps ten individuals. Like other canids, male fennecs mark their territory with urine and become <br>aggressive competitors when mating season arrives each year.

	Fennec foxes are opportunistic eaters. They forage for plants but also eat rodents, eggs, reptiles,<br> and insects. Like most desert dwellers, the fennec fox has developed the ability to go for long periods without water.

	These foxes are cream-colored with black-tipped<br>tails. Their adorable appearance makes them favorites of the captive pet trade, and local peoples also hunt the fennec fox for its fur. Little is known about the status<br> of wild fennec fox populations.</h3></section>
